# glb-viewer

[See glb-viewer in action](https://tonioloewald.github.io/glb-viewer/)

My goal is to create a simple script that could be embedded in any page and which
would then render any linked _glb_ files automagically.

If it's useful, I'll add configurability and more behavior (e.g. allow the user to
pan and zoom, play animations, etc.)

Usage: assuming you have the glb-viewer directory installed somewhere on a site,
you should be able to insert `<script src="path/to/glb-viewer.js"></script>`
at the bottom of your page and voila!
